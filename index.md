# Welcome to my website ðŸ˜Š
**I really enjoy making memes**

Some things I did to make my meme were:

- [x] Find some cute wolves
- [x] Put a border around the wolves
- [x] Pick awesome colours for the borders

Some code I used to create my awesome meme was:

- ``` image_oilpaint()```
- ```image_noise()```
- ```image_border()```

I got motivation to make my meme, by expressing how much fun I have using R to be creative as a change from data analysis

**Here is a website with some memes I like looking at**
